# Blockchain
This java based project is a simple implementation of Blockchaining. It allows the creation and initialization of various Wallets in which the user can send funds from one wallet 
to another through the use of public and private key encryption. 

All transactions are secured on the ledger because each hash depends on the previous hash. I set the genesis hash to the standard 00000.

Improved to include email confirmation.
